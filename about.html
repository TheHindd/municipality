The city is a major hub for education and tourism as well. The Lusignan era saw the majority of Famagusta's development, and the city is home to several historical relics from the Latin Kingdoms, the Venetians, the Turks, and the Roman and Eastern Roman Empires. The Venetian Palace, Othello Castle, St. Barnabas Monastery, Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque (St. Nicholas Cathedral), and golden beaches are a few of these.
                            The Turkish Municipality of Famagusta was initially founded in 1958. The 8,000â€“10,000 Turkish residents and Turkish neighborhoods were served by the Famagusta Turkish Municipality, which was granted legal standing in 1960 by the 1960 Constitution due to laws guaranteeing the distinct existence of Turkish and Greek municipalities. This arrangement lasted until 1974.</p>
